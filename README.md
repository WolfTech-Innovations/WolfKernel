## Overview

WolfKernel is an experimental Linux kernel that has been optimized for speed and minimal resource usage. It is designed to run efficiently on systems with limited resources while providing robust performance for tasks ranging from web browsing to advanced development environments.

---

## Features

- **Lightweight**: WolfKernel has been stripped down to include only the essential components for optimal performance on systems with limited resources.
- **Custom Optimizations**: The kernel is tweaked to offer better responsiveness, faster boot times, and improved multitasking for lower-end hardware.
- **Modular Design**: Keep only what you need, whether it's for desktop use, embedded systems, or servers. WolfKernel allows you to easily add or remove features.
- **Small Memory Footprint**: Designed to work efficiently with systems that 2GB+ RAM ammounts.
- **Security**: Regular updates and patches to keep your kernel secure, with options for hardened configurations if needed.
- **Customizable**: Provides various configuration options to tune the kernel for your specific needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system (either bare metal or virtualized).
- Root access or sudo privileges.
- Basic knowledge of Linux kernel compilation.

### Steps

1. **Download the Source**:
   Clone the repository to your system:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WolfTech-Innovations/WolfKernel.git
   cd WolfKernel
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have all the necessary tools for compiling the kernel:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev bc
   ```

3. **Configure the Kernel**:
   Use `make menuconfig` to configure your kernel. If you are aiming for minimal RAM usage, disable unnecessary features such as debugging, unneeded file systems, and large module support.
   ```bash
   make menuconfig
   ```

4. **Compile the Kernel**:
   Once youâ€™ve configured the kernel, compile it:
   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

5. **Install the Kernel**:
   After the kernel is built, install it:
   ```bash
   sudo make modules_install
   sudo make install
   ```

6. **Update Bootloader**:
   If using GRUB, make sure the bootloader is updated:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   ```

7. **Reboot**:
   Restart your system and select WolfKernel from the bootloader menu.

## Kernel Configuration

WolfKernel comes with a minimal configuration that is geared towards low-resource systems. However, you can further customize the kernel configuration according to your needs:

1. **Run `make menuconfig`** to open the kernel configuration menu.
2. **Optimize for Performance**:
   - Disable unnecessary drivers and file systems.
   - Enable only essential kernel modules for your system.
3. **Enable Hardware Support**:
   - Select the drivers and modules relevant to your hardware.
   - If you're unsure, leave the default settings or consult your hardware documentation.
4. **Optimize for Memory Efficiency**:
   - Configure kernel memory options to minimize memory usage.

---

## Optimizations

WolfKernel is designed with the following optimizations in mind:

- **Faster Boot Time**: Boot speed is optimized by disabling unnecessary services and features.
- **Responsive UI**: Despite being minimal, WolfKernel provides a stable and responsive experience, making it suitable for graphical desktop environments.
- **Memory Management**: Memory management settings are tuned to minimize swapping and improve performance on systems with limited RAM.

---

## Building WolfKernel

To build WolfKernel from source, follow the instructions under [Installation](#installation). Once compiled, you can test it on any machine with a compatible architecture.

- **CPU Architecture**: x86_64 (64-bit) architecture is currently supported.
- **Supported File Systems**: Ext4, Btrfs, and XFS (other file systems can be manually enabled during the kernel configuration process).

### Customizing for Your System
If you want to tailor the kernel to your hardware:
1. Use `make menuconfig` to enable or disable specific drivers.
2. Select the modules that match your system's requirements.

---

## Usage

Once installed, WolfKernel operates like any other Linux kernel. It can run graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and applications, with an optimized footprint that allows for a fast and smooth experience even on minimal hardware.

- You can run **lightweight desktop environments** like **Xfce** or **LXQt**, or use WolfKernel in embedded systems or headless servers for optimal resource usage.
- The kernel can be easily swapped in and out with other kernels via your bootloader.
